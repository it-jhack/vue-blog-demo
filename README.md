# Vue 3 + Vite Project: Blog CRUD

This is an application built with Vue 3 and Quasar Framework. It was
built with no end in mind, really. Just having some fun configuring the
framework from scratch and showcasing some neat quasar components üòÅ

## Features

### Seamless Dark Mode

Auto-detects browser preference and lets you switch themes on the fly. Because who doesn't love a good dark mode?

### Slick Design System

Built with Quasar's variables.sass for a cohesive look. Customization made easy!

### Responsive all the way!

Looks great on everything from your phone to your 4K monitor. No separate mobile version needed!

Powered by Pinia for smooth data flow. Because juggling state shouldn't be a circus act.
